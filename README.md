#About this Repo
This repository is about google map autocomplete and getting location by dragging the marker.
Once I came accross with dragging marker issue and I didn't get any solution. Finally I was able to solve the problem, and finally got the result callback from <b><i> Asynchronous Geocoder Function of Google.</i></b>
I've created these functions observable and was able to get the result callback.
These results are storable in any events or any local storage. You can use this result further in your app.
